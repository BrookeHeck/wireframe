# HTML/CSS Wireframe Exercise - 8a

## Wireframe Template
I built an app that will serve as a styling guide for the creation of other apps. It styles a basic html setup page using CSS. This app will allow for a quick foundation of a webpage, which can than be edited based on the specific purpose of that app.

### Reflections and Comments
I have always struggled with CSS selectors so this assignment was great practice with this. I also learned how helpful the inspection tool is on the browser. I can select an element with this tool and it will show me all the parents of that specific element. Getting practice with the flex properties was helpful as well. I like having this template for future projects and plan on incorporating it in with my lab 8.
